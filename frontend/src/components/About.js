        Sauce is a React web app that lets users create detailed notes about
        song structure and musical data such as scale, mode, bpm. This is a
        song-writer’s companion to focus on setting boundaries so as a musician,
        you can break rules and push the boundaries. Users can add their own
        songs (streaming from Soundcloud) or simply take note of some of their
        favorites songs as a way to gain insight from ‘studying the greats’.
